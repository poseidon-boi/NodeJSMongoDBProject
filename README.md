# NodeJSMongoDBProject

This is a full stack website project. The frontend sends an HTTP POST request to the backend. The backend fetches from a MongoDB server and returns it to the frontend. The frontend renders the data in cards.

## Frontend Website URL

https://cardsproject.vercel.app/

## Usage

Just visiting the URL will cause all of the cards to deploy. If the UUID of one of the cards is passed as a parameter in the URL, only that card will be displayed. Here's how you can do it.

https://cardsproject.vercel.app/?uuid=uuid-of-card
